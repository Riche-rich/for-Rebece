                        <p class="mb-4">My Dearest Rebeca,</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">I am sitting here, reading your words over and over again, and I find myself struggling to keep my hands steady. You said that I am your favorite notification, but Rebeca, <span class="bg-rose-100 px-1 rounded cursor-help" title="Key Finding: You are essential to my existence.">you are the heartbeat behind every second of my day.</span> Reading what you wrote didn't just bring a smile to my face; it brought a calmness to my soul that I didn’t know I was missing until you came into my life.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Six months. It has been six months since we stood in front of our parents, our friends, and God, and made a promise that changed the trajectory of our entire existence. When I look back at that day, and every single day leading up to today, I realize that saying "Yes" to you wasn't just a decision—it was destiny finally catching up with me. You wrote that you would have regretted saying no, but my love, I don’t even want to imagine a universe where you aren't mine. That version of reality is too dark, too quiet, and too empty for me to comprehend.</p>
                        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-rose-300 pl-4 italic my-6 text-gray-700">
                            "It isn't that we are perfect; it’s that our love is resilient."
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>You mentioned the journey—the happiness, the sadness, the tears, and yes, even the "cold wars." I want you to know that I cherish even those difficult moments. Why? Because every misunderstanding we overcame proved that we are worth fighting for. Every silence was broken by a stronger desire to understand each other. Those moments showed me that you aren't just here for the sunshine; you are here to hold the umbrella when it rains. That is what makes you the "right person."</p>

                        <p>I love the way you care for my family. You mentioned being blessed to have "Amma-like in-laws," but the blessing is truly ours.

You are not just a daughter-in-law to them; you are the daughter we all prayed for.</p>

It is me trying to get as close to your soul as possible. When I hug you, I am trying to shield you from everything bad in this world. When I hold your hand, I am anchoring myself to the only thing that matters.</p>
                        <p>You said, "From stranger to my main source of happiness." Think about that journey. Two people, living separate lives, suddenly colliding to create a single world. You own my heart completely. There is no corner of it that doesn't have your name carved into it.</p>

Rebeca, I am already making space for you in every closet, on every shelf, and in every empty moment of my day. I cannot wait for the mundane things. I can't wait for grocery shopping with you. I can't wait to argue over what movie to watch. I can't wait to taste the food you cook with so much love (even if I tease you about it).</p>
